## Key Features

1. **Loan Eligibility Prediction**
   - Uses machine learning models to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied.

2. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Secure login system with unique account ID and password creation for users and bank staff.

3. **Input Fields**
   - **Personal Details**: Name, Phone Number, Email ID, Address, and Pincode.
   - **Identity Proofs**: Aadhar Card, PAN Card, Driving License, or other government-approved documents.

4. **Staff Login Access**
   - Bank staff can log in to view and manage user details for verification and processing.

5. **Multilingual Support**
   - Accessibility in Tamil, English, Telugu, Hindi, and Malayalam.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple and intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Frameworks/Libraries**:
   - Flask (or Django) for backend and web interface
   - Pandas, NumPy for data processing and analysis
   - Scikit-learn for machine learning model development
   - Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
3. **Database**: SQLite/MySQL for storing user information and records
4. **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**
   - Users input personal and financial details through the web interface.

2. **Model Training**
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) is trained on a labeled dataset.

3. **Prediction**
   - The trained model predicts loan approval outcomes based on the provided input.

4. **User Access**
   - Registered users can securely log in to view their loan prediction results.
   - Bank staff can log in to review and manage user data for loan processing.
