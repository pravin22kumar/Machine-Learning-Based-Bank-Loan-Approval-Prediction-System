# Machine-Learning-Based-Bank-Loan-Approval-Prediction-System
Features
Loan Eligibility Prediction: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict loan approval outcomes.
User Registration & Authentication: Secure login system with unique account ID and password creation.
Input Fields:
Personal details: Name, Phone Number, Email ID, Address, and Pincode.
Identity Proofs: Aadhar Card, PAN Card, Driving License, or other government-approved documents.
Multilingual Support: Designed for accessibility in multiple languages (English, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam).
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for seamless user experience.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks/Libraries:
Flask (or Django) – For backend and web interface
Pandas, NumPy – Data processing and analysis
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model development
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Database: SQLite/MySQL (for storing user information and records)
Tools: Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook
How It Works
Data Collection: Users input personal and financial information.
Model Training: A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) is trained on a labeled dataset.
Prediction: The trained model predicts whether the loan application should be approved or denied.
User Access: Registered users can securely log in and view their loan prediction results.
